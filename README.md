# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict customer churn using historical customer data.
The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service and enable proactive retention strategies.

---

## Problem Statement

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue.
Predicting churn in advance allows companies to:

* Retain valuable customers
* Reduce acquisition costs
* Improve customer experience

---

## Solution Approach

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model training and comparison
* Model evaluation and selection

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

Models were compared using multiple evaluation metrics to select the best-performing model.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

Recall and F1-score were prioritized due to the cost of missing churned customers.

---

## Results

* Successfully trained and evaluated multiple ML models
* Selected the model with best generalization performance
* Demonstrated effective churn prediction on unseen data
